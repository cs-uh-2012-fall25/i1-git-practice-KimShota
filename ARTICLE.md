## What I found interesting about this article: 
I fully resonated with the core message of this article, which is **we need to embrace all the AI technologies available in this world and leverage them to build our critical thinking and new skills**. While AI can automatically generate simple, effective code for us, there are numerous things it still cannot achieve. These are the things that require **human perspectives and experiences, and critical thinking**. We, as humans, are very good at thinking critically while incorporating our various experiences and knowledge we have gained through the multisensory systems we possess, which is something AI does not possess at all. All AI can access is the knowledge that already exists on the internet. AI cannot access real, personal experiences in the world that humans go through. Thus, we can still do a better job of *understanding what clients need and actually building effective, technical solutions that satisfy customersâ€™ needs*. Furthermore, the article mentioned it is important for us to *integrate AI-generated code effectively into existing systems, where very technical, high-level knowledge is required*. Being able to understand how the entire code and system of an application works and to fill in the gaps is something AI is incapable of doing at the moment. Lastly, I really resonated with the idea of **using AI as a teacher**. AI has definitely made it easier and faster for us to understand complex concepts, and it can introduce us to new concepts that enhance our code and functionality. I am personally using AI to teach myself how to get better at analyzing data with multiple ML/DL techniques, so it has been a very good journey.
